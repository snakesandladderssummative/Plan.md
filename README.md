1. First, I'll show the user the rules of my snakes and ladders game.
2. Then I will create a dice that holds random integers 1-6.
3. I will then create a 2 dimensional array that will act like a 10x10 gameboard.
4. The next thing that I will do is allow the user roll to move a piece on the board based off of what they roll 
   Example : Player 1 Rolled a 1  [p1] [88]  -----> [87] [p1] 
5. Player 1 will be called "P1" and player 2 will be called "P2"
6. Snakes and ladders will have to be indicated on the board they won't have random locations. Example : [S] is snake [L].
7. Allow snakes to move the player back to a certain number while ladders move them up a certain number.
8. When player 1 or player 2 reach 100 on the game board declare that they're the winner.
9. Allow the players to restart the game.

## My Goal
* Create a working Snakes and Ladders program.
* The program will include the game board and allow for two player to play, there will only be two players.
* There will be a dice that roles 1-6 randomly and it will switch between player 1 and 2 everytime each player rolls the dice.
* The board will show where the players are by indicating it using certain letters and numbers.
* The board will have certain letters representing snakes and ladders. 
* The ladders will bring the players to a higher number while the snakes will bring them down to a lower number on the game board.
* The players will be told when it's their turn and will be told what they rolled.
* When one of the players reaches the end of the board which is 100 they'll be told that they've won.
* The program will ask them if they want to play again.

### Going furthur

* Adding a computer player that will play vs the user
